<p>This application can connect to your Nintendo Wii U console over the local network and perform memory modifications.
    In order for this to work, you need to run <a href="http://wj44.bplaced.net/osdriver/payload532.html">the kernel
        exploit</a> and <a href="http://wj44.bplaced.net/pyGecko4/payload532.html">PyGecko
        installer</a> before starting Mario Kart 8.
    Only Mario Kart 8 <b>version 4.1</b> is supported since it's the latest available so <a
            href="http://wupinstaller.com/">
        make
        sure you update yours</a>. The Wii U natively has to be on <b>firmware 5.3.2 and below</b> to be publicly
    exploitable as of now.
</p>

<p>Make sure that your TCP Gecko.NET or any other application that can connect to the Wii U is disconnected when trying
    to apply any patches since they will not take effect until then.
