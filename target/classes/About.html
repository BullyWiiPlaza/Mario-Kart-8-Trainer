<body><h1>Mario Kart 8 Trainer v2.0 by Bully@WiiPlaza</h1>

<p>This application can connect to your Nintendo Wii U console over the local network and perform memory modifications.
    In order for this to work, you need to <a href="http://wj44.bplaced.net/osdriver/payload532.html">run the Homebrew Launcher
        </a> and <a href="http://wj44.bplaced.net/pyGecko4/payload532.html">my TCP Gecko Installer</a> before starting Mario Kart 8.
    Only game version <b>4.1</b> is supported since it's the latest available so <a
            href="http://wupinstaller.com/">
        make
        sure you update yours</a>.
</p>

<p>Make sure that your JGecko U or any other client application is disconnected when trying
    to apply any patches since they will not take effect until then.
